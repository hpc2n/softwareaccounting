# Versions of reported software

Software should be reported with a name and major version number.

The versionstr can represent a local version number with patches.

As a general rule never send in a version number with more then two levels. For example "Python/3.7.1" should be sent as "Python/3.7".

## Unknown or unclassified software

Software from user home directories and project storage are to be reported as *software*=*unclassified* with a empty *version*. *versionstr* can be used for tracing user, project, directories or simular.
